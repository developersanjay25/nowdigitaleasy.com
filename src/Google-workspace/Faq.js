    {
        ques : `Is Google Workspace compatible with the email client I use today like Outlook / Thunderbird ?`,
        ans : `In addition to accessing Google Workspace mail from the Gmail web interface, you can send and receive mail from your favorite desktop client like Outlook / Thunderbird.

    },
    {
        ques : `Should I use POP or IMAP ?`,
        ans : `Prefer IMAP, if you are going to be accessing your email from multiple devices, such as a work computer and a smartphone.
        Prefer POP3, if you are only using one device.
        POP3 is better if you have a poor internet connection, very large number of emails and need to access your emails offline.`
    },
    {
        ques : `What's better POP or IMAP ?`,
        ans : `For most users, IMAP is a better choice than POP.
        POP is a very old way of receiving mail in an email client. It only lets you download your Inbox on your computer, and not any other folders.
        IMAP is the current standard for syncing your emails and lets you see all your folders on your email client.`
    },
    {
        ques : `Can we mix IMAP and pop3 ?`,
        ans : `If you're using multiple devices, you use IMAP across all devices.
        If it's a single device and mail is to be stored (not accessed via the server in the future) then POP3.
        Mixing these 2 is a huge no-no, while it may work well for a few months and maybe years â€” you'll eventually have problems.
        Mixing POP and IMAP can be very problematic and result in some quite bizarre behavior.
        IMAP is a far more robust solution for multiple devices accessing the same mailbox.`
    },
    {
        ques : `Which mobile phones can I access my mail from ?`,
        ans : `Your email can be accessed using any Smartphone or Tablet.
        The Gmail interface is compatible on all major Operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, Symbian and Blackberry.`
    },
    {
        ques : `What is your SPAM policy ?`,
        ans : `When you sign up for a Google Workspace account, you agree not to use the account to send spam, distribute viruses, or otherwise abuse the service.
        All users on your domain are subject to these agreements, which are part of the Google Workspace Acceptable Use Policy.
        If Google identifies a Google Workspace user who is violating these agreements then we reserve the right to immediately suspend the user.
        If the problem is domain-wide, we reserve the right to suspend the entire account and deny administrator access to all the Google Workspace services.
        In such cases, we send a notification to the registered secondary email address for the domain administrator.`
